        <h1>AMERICAN SCHOLARSHIPS FOR NIGERIANS</h1>
        <p>The word ‘SCHOLARSHIP’ means or refers to “a grant or payment made to support a student’s 
            education, awarded on the basis of academics or other Achievement”. An American scholarship would therefore mean a grant or 
            payment made by an American based Institution or body to support and individual’s academic career.</p> <br>
        <p>American scholarships are always competitive in the sense that: there are a lot of students and individuals
            applying from all over the world. In most cases, Institutions, Firms or Bodies awarding out scholarships always have
             limited funds on ground therefore making it highly competitive as such grants are mostly awarded to the best in the pool of applicants.</p><br>

        <p>As a Nigerian seeking to study at an American based institute of learning, it is important to apply for scholarships and grants as they may one way or the other help clear some needs 
            as a student if you’re offered an admission. As a Nigerian student or individual applying for a grant, you will need to excel at the well-known and recognized examinations. An individual 
            may decide to submit a preferred test score from (SAT – Scholastic Assessment Test [conducted by the College Board], ACT – American College Test [conducted by the ACT], AP – Advanced Placement
             test, CLT – Classic Learning Test, THEA – Texas Higher Education Assessment, GED – HSE or High School Diploma, PERT – Replaced Accuplacer as the Standard College Placement 
             Test in Florida. TOEFL – Test of English as a Foreign Language, IELTS – International English Language Testing System. The popularly known test written by many Nigerians are the ACT, SAT, IELTS and TOEFL.</p><br>
        <img src="res/images/1 (1).png" class="postpics" alt=""><br><br>
        <p>Before applying to a scholarship program, it is essential to take and excel in at least 2 of the above-mentioned exams as an applicant will be competing with over a million of 
            other applicants who also applied to same scholarship programs. It is also advisable to diversify your applications to other Colleges that may offer you and admission due to their 
            acceptance rates and other statistics. As a Nigerian applicant, it is advisable to apply for scholarships since the cost of living in the states and tuition fees are dramatically 
            expensive even if a student’s funding source is capable, it is profitable to apply for one. </p><br>
        <img src="res/images/1 (3).jpg" class="postpics" alt=""><br><br>
        <p>To qualify for or stand out to winning a scholarship from the massive pool of applicants, a Nigerian student should excel at testing exams and also at the West African Examinations 
            Council (WAEC). Some American based colleges and universities claim to respect a test blind policy but, in most cases, they don’t. they may put up the “Test Blind Policy” statement 
            but will still give you the chance to send your test score if you have any, submitting your test score makes you stand out from those who didn’t submit theirs, having a 
            higher score makes you stand out from those with a lower score. </p><br>
        <img src="res/images/1 (2).jpg" class="postpics" alt=""><br><br>
        <p>The SAT is totaled a “1600”, the lowest SAT score is 400, your test score is composed of a Math Section score and an Evidence – Based Reading and writing 
            score. Each SAT score is scored between 200 and 800 points, there are no deductions of points for failed questions so its advisable to attempt all questions 
            if you have no idea on answering a question. The highest ACT score possible is “36”, the current average ACT score is 21. Writing and excelling at both the SAT 
            and ACT ranks or places you above your fellow applicants therefore making your profile stand out from the large pool. In fewer cases, test scores do not really 
            determine if a candidate would receive a grant as some Colleges and Universities deal more on the activities outside the classroom, so its very important for an applicant
             to balance the classroom activities and extra-curricular activities to furthermore standout to receive a grant. Extra-curricular activities may include but are not limited
              to Sporting activities, Voluntary services at groups such as Red Cross, at an Animal Shelter, a Life Guard Support, a Local Organization, Chaperone a field trip, Drama, Dance,
               Athletics, Art, Photography and others.</p><br>
        <img src="res/images/1 (1).jpg" class="postpics" alt=""><br><br>
        <p>Before applying to a Scholarship Program, it is important to get the following in place: <br>
            1.	Test score(s) {SAT [1450 – 1600], or/and the ACT [27 – 36]}<br>
            2.	WAEC {5A’s and above or mixed with B’s}<br>
            3.	Extra-Curricular activities {Mostly voluntary services like the Red Cross and Road Safety}<br>
            When the above listed options are in place, a candidate stands a greater chance of competing with other high ranked applicants who are most likely accepted or offered the grants applied for.
            For more clearance, a Nigerian based candidate may consult/visit the EducationUSA team at the American Embassy (Abuja or Lagos).
